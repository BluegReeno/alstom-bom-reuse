# alstom-bom-reuse

> Status: work in progress. Built in a 4-hour timebox for the Cognyx FDE case study
> (fictional pilot at Alstom Valenciennes). All data is synthetic.

## The problem

When a new tender comes in, engineers cannot tell which of the sub-assemblies it needs already
exist in past train variants. The data does not let anyone recognize that a part or a
sub-assembly is the same from one variant to the next: duplicated references with typos, mixed
units, free-text notes in French and English that sometimes contradict the Bill of Materials.
So what already exists is re-designed and re-costed.

**The problem this tool solves: for a given variant, identify every sub-assembly that already
exists in the other variants — identical, or reusable with a known diff — and flag the
inconsistencies that would make reuse unsafe.**

## How it answers it

1. **The foundation.** A deduplicated catalogue of sub-assemblies across all existing variants,
   each with where it is used, classified:
   - *reused* — identical across variants;
   - *reusable* — near-identical, with the exact diff;
   - *specific* — used by one variant only;

   plus the list of inconsistencies (duplicate references, unit conflicts, supplier or cost
   conflicts, notes contradicting the BOM). This answers the brief's question: *which
   sub-assemblies are reused — or reusable — across variants, and where are the
   inconsistencies?*
2. **The proof of use (backtest).** The newest variant plays "the new tender". Given only the
   older variants, the tool says which of its sub-assemblies already existed, and compares
   itself with a naive search by exact reference on the same data. The gap between the two is
   the measured value.

| In scope | Out of scope |
| --- | --- |
| Finding what already exists for a given variant, with evidence | Decomposing a new design to make it reusable later (CAD and engineering work, not data) |
| Flagging inconsistencies that make a reuse unsafe | Fixing the data in the PLM: the tool only proposes |
| Measuring how much an exact-reference search misses | Estimating time or money saved: defined with the client |

Primary user: the design engineer preparing a tender.

## What the synthetic data contains, and why

The dataset is designed backwards from the problem: each property exists so that one claim can
be measured.

- Variants with a chronology (design date, region, seats, bike spaces, traction). The newest is
  the "new tender".
- Hidden reuse: sub-assemblies of the newest variant identical in content to older ones, under
  new or typo'd references.
- Near-reuse: sub-assemblies differing from an older one by 1–3 parts.
- Genuinely new sub-assemblies, so the tool cannot claim that everything already exists.
- Unsafe reuse: a matched older sub-assembly containing a part a note declares obsolete.
- A ground truth, read only by the evaluation, never by the pipeline.
